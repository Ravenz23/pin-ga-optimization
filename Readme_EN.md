# Genetic Algorithm for Benchmark Function Optimization

⚠️ **Important Note:** The code for this project is __not yet complete__.
 - It contains various test functions and may be "polluted". We are working to clean up and finalize the code.

## Project Description
This project implements a genetic algorithm in Python to solve benchmark functions for optimization purposes. Genetic algorithms are techniques inspired by natural evolution to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.
